# PuzzleAdvent2021

This project contains my C# solutions to the 2021 Advent Of Code (https://adventofcode.com/) puzzles.

Note that the Code\Data folder contains two sets of data files: InputN.txt and TestN.txt. The TestN.txt files are unit test data copied from the AoC website. You should not change these files at all. The InputN.txt files are the "real" data used to run the code and submit an answer back to the website. However, as each participant in this adventure gets their own set of input data, the particular files in this repository won't be of any use to you. However, you can overwrite their contents with your own data and get submittable results.
